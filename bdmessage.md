Ah! I see that you're wondering who might have sent you this gift. Its me, sir, your humble friend. Why did I choose this book for you, you might ask. That’s a good question. Well, sir, It's because you wanted to read this book. How do I know that, you might wonder. Well, It appeared in my goodreads updates feed.

I came across this book while browsing through the wooden shelves in in the hotel I was staying in Ooty.  Have you ever had the pleasure of finding a great book in places you hadn't expected, sir? It’s a delightful feeling , I tell you. The unique narration style of the author will capture your attention instantly.

Oh! I see you're getting bored. Very well, sir. I'll leave it you then. I hope you enjoy the book, sir.  

Ah, Amidst all the excitement, I forgot to tell you [something] (http://foaas.com/bday/bro/Ennu Ninte, Ankita.), sir.
